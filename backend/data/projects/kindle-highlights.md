# Kindle Highlights
This project automates the syncing of my Kindle highlights using **Linux bash scripts**. The workflow extracts, cleans, and organizes all highlights into a structured format.

It helped me learn:

- How to work efficiently in Linux  
- Shell scripting fundamentals  
- Automating repetitive tasks
