# Cloud Resume Challenge
This project is my implementation of the **Cloud Resume Challenge**, a serverless resume website built entirely on **AWS**. It includes a static frontend, API, database, and CI/CD pipeline.

Through this project I practiced:

- Serverless architecture  
- Working with AWS services  
- Automating deployments and infrastructure
