          <div class="item">
            <p class="small">The question “How can I be more useful?” has guided every step of my career. I believe fulfilment comes from solving meaningful problems and helping others work more effectively. Over more than a decade in logistics and five years as a training coach, I’ve learned that clarity, active listening, and structured collaboration are the foundation of great results.</p>
            <p class="small">Working daily with M3, I became fascinated by how technology can simplify complexity. This curiosity led me to study cloud computing, automation, and data analytics in my free time. Learning AWS, Python, and Excel automation has deepened my understanding of how systems connect and strengthened my drive to improve how people and technology work together.</p>
